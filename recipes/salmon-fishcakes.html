        <h2>Surprisingly simple, yet full of flavour</h2>
        <p>Simple and delicious fishcakes that work great as a focal point of a dish, or as a wonderful side dish</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14.75 ounce) can salmon, drained and flaked</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick through salmon to remove any bones or large pieces of skin.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a mixing bowl. Stir in salmon, onion, and black pepper. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Shape salmon mixture into eight 2-ounce patties.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry patties until crispy and golden brown on the outsides, about 5 minutes per side; work in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan.</li>
        </ol>
